# Welcome! 

I am currently an undergraduate student at [Yonsei University](https://cs.yonsei.ac.kr/), South Korea, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My academic focus is centered around software engineering and research, with a strong interest in understanding the complexities of technology and its practical applications.

As I continue my studies, I am eager to expand my knowledge in emerging fields of technology and deepen my understanding of areas such as artificial intelligence, software development, and data science. I am actively seeking opportunities to work on collaborative projects, join internships, and engage in research that will help me grow as a professional in the tech industry.

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential opportunities. I'm always open to new challenges and excited to contribute to innovative projects in the field.

- *Have You Metï¼ŒNY, USA*:
  - Have You Met is a dating social app that focuses on providing users with more accurate and meaningful matches by leveraging AI and image processing technology. My primary goal during the internship was to enhance the accuracy of user matching recommendations by improving the processing of profile images.
  - Designed and implemented an API to process user profile images, integrating Google Cloud for secure authentication and utilizing Google AI APIs to generate image embeddings. These embeddings were specifically used to improve the precision of user recommendations within the app's matching system.
Led the integration with Google Cloud services to ensure efficient retrieval of image embeddings, which significantly contributed to refining the accuracy of the matching algorithm, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction.
  - Optimized the API for scalability and performance, implementing best practices in API design and cloud resource management, which enabled the platform to handle high volumes of user data without impacting matching speed or reliability.
  - Collaborated with the algorithm development team to apply the retrieved image embeddings to the user recommendation engine, resulting in a 10% increase in match accuracy and improving the overall user experience on the platform.
  
- *Database Labï¼ŒYonsei University*:
  - Conducted in-depth research and hands-on implementation of big data preprocessing and post-processing techniques
  - Applied data partitioning and sharding methods to optimize big data processing workflows
  - Performed database querying and tuning using Python (DataFrame) and MariaDB
  - Developed Web UI for big data visualization and presentation
