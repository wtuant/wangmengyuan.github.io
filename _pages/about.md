# Welcome! 

I am currently an undergraduate student at Yonsei University, South Korea, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My academic focus is centered around software engineering and research, with a strong interest in understanding the complexities of technology and its practical applications.

As I continue my studies, I am eager to expand my knowledge in emerging fields of technology and deepen my understanding of areas such as artificial intelligence, software development, and data science. I am actively seeking opportunities to work on collaborative projects, join internships, and engage in research that will help me grow as a professional in the tech industry.

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential opportunities. I'm always open to new challenges and excited to contribute to innovative projects in the field.
